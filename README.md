# ProjectTutoRial
Repository for a video game entitled Project Tuto Rial, developed as part of an undergraduate project.

## Developers:
Bao Duong (bduong11037@gmail.com),
Matthew Jun (Mjemailbox91@gmail.com), &
Ethan Jones (ethanjones421@yahoo.com)

## Project Description:
A 3D ARPG, similar to The Legend of ZeldaTM: Breath of the Wild and the Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade.
Tuto Rial will incorporate an open world where the character can run, explore, fight, and solve puzzles. 
The camera will focus on the player in a 3-person view.

## More Info:
This game was developed using the Godot Game engine version 4.2.1 with assets created in Blender.
Programming was done in C# and GDScript based on the developer's taste.

## How To Run It:
Currently, Project Tuto Rial may be run within the Godot game engine by creating a clone of this repository
and running the game as you regularly would within Godot.
In the future, we will be releasing a release version that may be played natively on IOS, Linux, and Windows.
We may also release the game for download on e-stores such as Steam or the Epic Games store.
